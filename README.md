## 1.Updated App Based on Feedback
Updated my app based on feedback. The feedback stated that my menu was positioned incorrectly, so I moved it to the top of the screen to make the app more user-friendly.

## 2. Added Average Function
Added the average function on the Home Screen. This allows users to view the average price for specific courses, starters, mains, and desserts as well as the overall average of all menu items.

## 3. Added Filter Screen
Added the Filter Screen to improve user experience. This feature allows users to view only specific categories, such as starters, mains, or desserts, depending on their preferences.

Fixed a color contrast issue where some text was difficult to read. Updated font colors to ensure all writing is clearly visible and accessible to users.

## 5. Added Delete Button
Added a delete button in case a user makes a mistake or changes their mind. This gives users more control and flexibility when managing menu items.
